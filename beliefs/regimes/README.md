# Belief Regimes

A **belief regime** is a non-diegetic reconstruction of a historically contingent configuration of motif, practice, transmission, and relationship to power.

Belief regimes:
- are time-bounded (fuzzy, attestation-based bounds are allowed)
- can overlap and fragment
- do not imply doctrinal unity

Use the template in `templates/BELIEF_REGIME_HIPF_TEMPLATE.md`.
