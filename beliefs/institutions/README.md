# Belief-Linked Institutions

Non-diegetic reference docs for institutions that carry, enforce, or instrumentalize belief.

Examples:
- priestly colleges
- temple networks
- inquisitorial courts
- monastic orders

If an institution changes materially over time, prefer multiple time-bounded documents.
