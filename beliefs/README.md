# Beliefs (Non-Diegetic)

This directory contains non-diegetic reference material for modeling religions, cults, and belief systems.

- `regimes/`: time-bounded belief regime documents (configurations of motif, practice, transmission, and power relations).
- `institutions/`: priesthoods, colleges, temples, courts, and other belief-linked institutions (time-bounded where needed).
- `notes/`: cross-regime lineage notes, modeling notes, and methodological guidance.

Do not place in-world texts here; those belong in `corpus/`.

Belief regime documents should align to HICEL `BeliefRegimeModel` representation conventions.
