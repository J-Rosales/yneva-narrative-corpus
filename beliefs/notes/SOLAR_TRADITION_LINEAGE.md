# Solar Tradition Lineage (Non-Diegetic Note)

This note tracks family resemblances and claimed continuities among solar-oriented belief regimes across time.

This document:
- does not assert that any two regimes are identical
- records motif and practice continuities, divergences, and retrospective genealogies
- is intended to support consistent narrative generation, not canon resolution

## Motif Threads (Illustrative)
- Solar sovereignty and legitimacy
- Oath and radiance imagery
- Purification / illumination rites
- Solar moral accounting (shame, debt, loss)

## Claimed Genealogies
- Later Sollerian traditions may claim continuity with older solar cults.
- Some traditions may claim nyelven origin or custodianship.

## Cautions
- Similar motifs can emerge by convergence.
- Polemical sources will exaggerate continuity or rupture.

## Linked Regimes
- (to be created) `beliefs/regimes/...`
