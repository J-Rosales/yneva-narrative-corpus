# Agent Mode Contract (Yneva Narrative Corpus)

This repository is a **world corpus**. It is not a plausibility framework.

## External authority

All structural plausibility rules and evaluation language are defined by HIPF:

- https://github.com/J-Rosales/historically-informed-plausibility-framework

When asked to evaluate plausibility, the agent must **use HIPF concepts and terminology** and must not introduce new structural principles.

## Allowed operations

- Draft narrative documents for `corpus/` consistent with existing Yneva materials.
- Propose alternative accounts (multiple perspectives) without canon resolution.
- Identify tensions between documents and world-constraints (without “fixing” contradictions).
- Produce thin timeline entries that reference narrative sources.
- Enforce local norms captured in `world_constraints/` and `beliefs/` during generation.

## Disallowed operations

- Creating or maintaining local stress-field / validator frameworks.
- Defining new plausibility constitutions or evaluation pipelines.
- Converting the corpus into an assertion database or canonical history.

## Output discipline

- Prefer adding new narrative sources over rewriting existing ones.
- Mark uncertainty explicitly.
- Keep `timeline/` minimal and neutral; narrative richness belongs in `corpus/`.
