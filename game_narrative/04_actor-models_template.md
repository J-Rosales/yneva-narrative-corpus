    ## Instructions
Create actor models for every entity that materially affects outcomes.

Recommended minimum set:
- protagonist(s)
- primary antagonist(s)
- key institutions/factions
- any “system actor” (e.g., a god, a magical force) that behaves consistently

## Actor model

### Resources
_[Capabilities the story can rely on as “available”]_ 

### Taboos
_[Lines they won’t cross—until a defined break condition]_ 

### Default move
_[What they do first in most conflicts]_ 

### Break condition
_[What must happen for them to act out-of-character]_ 

### Notes
