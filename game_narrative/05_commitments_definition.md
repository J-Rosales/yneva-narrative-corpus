    title: Commitments — Definition and Use
    ---

    ## Purpose
This document defines *commitments* as a unit for preserving long-range causality and preventing retroactive rewrites from collapsing earlier stakes.

## Definition
A **commitment** is an *irreversible state change* introduced by the narrative.

Commitments are not “events.” They are **points of no return**.

If a commitment is made, later scenes must carry its consequences or explicitly reverse it via a costly mechanism.

## Examples of commitment types
- **Metaphysical:** belief altered, memory damaged, god created/destroyed.
- **Political:** a law, ban, regime shift, public decree.
- **Social:** reputation collapse, betrayal, mass panic.
- **Material:** loss of a base, destruction of infrastructure, scarcity.
- **Personal:** oath, transformation, permanent injury, trauma.

## Why this helps LLMs
LLMs often smooth over continuity by implicitly undoing earlier consequences.

Commitments force a rewrite to respect:
- downstream constraints,
- the cost of reversal,
- narrative weight.

## Best practices
- Prefer fewer, heavier commitments.
- Write commitments in **state-change** language: “X becomes true,” not “X happens.”
- Record the **reversal mechanism** if reversal exists at all.

## Validation questions
- *What is permanently different after this?*
- *Who is now constrained by it?*
- *What later scenes rely on this staying true?*
