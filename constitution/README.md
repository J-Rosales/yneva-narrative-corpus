# Constitution

This repository does **not** define an internal plausibility constitution.

All structural plausibility rules, admissibility criteria, evaluative language, and failure-mode taxonomies are defined by the **Historically Informed Plausibility Framework (HIPF)**:

- https://github.com/J-Rosales/historically-informed-plausibility-framework

Representation conventions and schema structure are defined by the **Historically-Informed Causal Encoding Layer (HICEL)**:

- https://github.com/J-Rosales/historically-informed-causal-encoding-layer

## Yneva-specific parameterization

Yneva-specific constraints and affordances belong in:

- `world_constraints/` (non-diegetic world-instance constraints)
- `beliefs/` (non-diegetic reconstructions of belief patterns)
- `timeline/` (thin index chronology)

No document in this repository may introduce new global structural principles or evaluation rules.
