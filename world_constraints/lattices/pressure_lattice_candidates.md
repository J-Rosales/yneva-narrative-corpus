# Pressure Lattice Candidates (Confirmation)

This document confirms candidate **lattices, lenses, axes, and pressures** for Yneva while explicitly noting that **species baselines modify expression**. These are **world-instance constraints** that reference HIPF, not a new plausibility framework.

## Species Modifiers (Confirmation Step)

Species baselines (e.g., nyelven constraints) act as **modifiers on how lattices express** without replacing the lattices themselves. For example:
- **Demography lattice** reacts differently under low fertility and long lifespans.
- **Administrative capacity** is bounded by elite scarcity and long-lived institutional memory.
- **Legitimacy and succession** emphasize continuity and ritual authority over rapid dynastic churn.

Species-specific modifiers should be applied from the relevant `world_constraints/species/` documents, without redefining HIPF lattice criteria.

## Candidate Lattices (7 total)

These are the proposed consequence lattices that gate plausibility across the Bronze Age → High Middle Ages arc:

1. **Administrative Capacity Lattice**
   - Domain: institutional reach (taxation, record-keeping, logistics, coercive coordination).
   - Gating: limits scope of governance, reform, and durable centralized projects.

2. **Legitimacy & Succession Lattice**
   - Domain: perceived right to rule, ritual authority, dynastic continuity.
   - Gating: constrains regime stability and likelihood of durable rule.

3. **Demography & Settlement Viability Lattice**
   - Domain: population size, health, migration balance, settlement stability.
   - Gating: constrains labor availability, military size, and colonization plausibility.

4. **Agrarian Carrying & Food Security Lattice**
   - Domain: yield reliability, storage, distribution, soil exhaustion.
   - Gating: constrains city size, surplus extraction, and famine resilience.

5. **Military Logistics & Mobilization Lattice**
   - Domain: muster capacity, supply durability, campaign endurance.
   - Gating: constrains the duration/scope of warfare and frontier control.

6. **Trade & Exchange Resilience Lattice**
   - Domain: trade-route reliability, chokepoints, merchant safety.
   - Gating: constrains access to critical materials and the durability of urban wealth.

7. **Infrastructure & Built Environment Lattice**
   - Domain: roads, canals, irrigation, fortifications, ports.
   - Gating: constrains movement speed, integration, and defensive plausibility.

## Candidate Lenses (expression modifiers)

Lenses shape how lattices manifest without adding new gates:
- **Ecological Lens** (aridity, river regimes, volcanic soils)
- **Frontier Lens** (steppe/forest/mountain interfaces)
- **Religious-Authority Lens** (cult centralization vs. local syncretism)
- **Ethnolinguistic Mosaic Lens** (diversity shaping institutions)
- **Maritime Orientation Lens** (coastal vs. inland societies)
- **Metallurgy Lens** (bronze/iron accessibility)
- **Calendar/Ritual Lens** (seasonal labor obligations)

## Candidate Axes (context descriptors)

Axes describe persistent world variation that conditions narratives without gating plausibility:
- **Centralized ↔ Fragmented Polity Structure**
- **Maritime ↔ Terrestrial Orientation**
- **Urbanized ↔ Dispersed Settlement Pattern**
- **Ritual-Heavy ↔ Pragmatic Governance**
- **Closed ↔ Open Trade Posture**
- **Dynastic ↔ Charismatic Succession Norms**

## Candidate Pressures (stressors/shocks)

Pressures drive lattice transitions and are applied through quick-scan consequence channels:
- **Climatic Volatility** (multi-year drought or flood cycles)
- **Succession Crisis** (interregnum, disputed heirs)
- **Epidemic Waves** (localized or regional)
- **Resource Depletion** (soil exhaustion, timber scarcity)
- **Trade Disruption** (piracy, collapsed routes)
- **Frontier Incursions** (raids, migrations)
- **Technological Inflection** (iron adoption, new siege methods)
- **Religious Schism** (ritual authority fracture)

## Orthogonality Notes (Summary)

Each lattice introduces a distinct gating constraint not reconstructible by the others (e.g., demography is not reducible to agrarian output; legitimacy is not reducible to administrative capacity). Lenses and axes describe expression and context only.
