# Justification for Selected Lattices, Lenses, Axes, and Pressures

This document records **why each selected lattice, lens, axis, and pressure** is retained for Yneva. It does not redefine HIPF rules; it only justifies **world-instance choices**.

## Lattices (Why These 7)

1. **Administrative Capacity Lattice**
   - **Why needed:** Plausibility of centralized action, durable reforms, and extraction cannot be inferred from other lattices alone. Administrative decay can occur even with stable demography or food security.
   - **Species modifier:** Elite scarcity and long-lived institutional memory (e.g., nyelven) alters how capacity accumulates and how losses compound.

2. **Legitimacy & Succession Lattice**
   - **Why needed:** Regime stability and obedience cannot be derived from infrastructure or trade conditions alone; legitimacy gates continuity even under strong material capacity.
   - **Species modifier:** Ritual authority and continuity dominate succession logic for long-lived species; legitimacy shocks are slower but deeper.

3. **Demography & Settlement Viability Lattice**
   - **Why needed:** Population recovery and settlement persistence constrain labor, warfare, and colonization independently of agrarian output.
   - **Species modifier:** Low fertility and long lifespans mean demographic shocks are effectively irreversible on historical time scales.

4. **Agrarian Carrying & Food Security Lattice**
   - **Why needed:** Food supply plausibly gates city size, surplus extraction, and famine risk even when trade or administration is otherwise strong.
   - **Species modifier:** Long planning horizons can stabilize storage and rotation practices but magnify shock aversion.

5. **Military Logistics & Mobilization Lattice**
   - **Why needed:** The capacity to sustain campaigns is distinct from administrative competence or population size; mobilization can fail despite strong legitimacy.
   - **Species modifier:** Casualty intolerance and elite scarcity alter acceptable campaign length and risk tolerance.

6. **Trade & Exchange Resilience Lattice**
   - **Why needed:** Access to critical materials and wealth circulation depends on route security and chokepoints, not just agrarian output or governance.
   - **Species modifier:** Societies with long time horizons may favor conservative trade patterns, making disruptions more destabilizing.

7. **Infrastructure & Built Environment Lattice**
   - **Why needed:** Built assets (roads, canals, fortifications) decay on their own timelines and gate movement, integration, and defense independently of trade or administration.
   - **Species modifier:** Long-lived builders can sustain continuity, but repair cycles stretch over centuries, making collapse protracted.

**Stopping rule:** Adding further lattices would refine description without creating new plausibility gates at this scope.

## Lenses (Why These)

- **Ecological Lens:** Environmental context shapes how agrarian and demographic lattices express without introducing new gates.
- **Frontier Lens:** Interface zones alter military, trade, and legitimacy expression (e.g., raids, frontier autonomy).
- **Religious-Authority Lens:** Modifies legitimacy and administrative expression (ritual compliance vs. pragmatic governance).
- **Ethnolinguistic Mosaic Lens:** Shapes institutional cohesion and information transmission without gating outcomes alone.
- **Maritime Orientation Lens:** Modifies trade resilience and infrastructure priorities (ports vs. roads).
- **Metallurgy Lens:** Alters military and economic expression through material availability.
- **Calendar/Ritual Lens:** Shapes seasonal labor coordination and administrative cycles.

Each lens was retained because it **modifies expression** of multiple lattices without replacing any lattice’s gating role.

## Axes (Why These)

Axes provide stable descriptors for regional or epochal differentiation:
- **Centralized ↔ Fragmented Polity Structure:** Conditions administrative and legitimacy expression.
- **Maritime ↔ Terrestrial Orientation:** Conditions infrastructure and trade expression.
- **Urbanized ↔ Dispersed Settlement Pattern:** Conditions demography and agrarian expression.
- **Ritual-Heavy ↔ Pragmatic Governance:** Conditions legitimacy and administrative expression.
- **Closed ↔ Open Trade Posture:** Conditions trade resilience expression.
- **Dynastic ↔ Charismatic Succession Norms:** Conditions legitimacy expression.

Axes are descriptive and do not gate plausibility independently.

## Pressures (Why These)

Each pressure is a common historical shock channel relevant to the Bronze–Medieval arc and drives lattice transitions:
- **Climatic Volatility:** Directly impacts agrarian and demographic lattices.
- **Succession Crisis:** Directly tests legitimacy and administrative lattices.
- **Epidemic Waves:** Directly impacts demography and military mobilization.
- **Resource Depletion:** Pressures agrarian and infrastructure lattices.
- **Trade Disruption:** Pressures trade and administrative lattices.
- **Frontier Incursions:** Pressures military and legitimacy lattices.
- **Technological Inflection:** Pressures military, infrastructure, and trade lattices.
- **Religious Schism:** Pressures legitimacy and administrative lattices.

Species baselines alter **severity, pacing, and recovery** but do not replace these pressure channels.
