# Major Periods

This document defines the current high-level periodization of the Yneva world chronology.

These periods are **historiographical partitions**, not claims of canonical truth.
They exist to provide a shared vocabulary for organizing `timeline/` and for indexing the `corpus/`.

## Archaic Period (19976 B.R. – 418 B.R.)
A deep-time interval characterized by low-resolution chronology and high interpretive uncertainty.
Most material is mythic, lacunose, or mediated through much later narrative traditions.

## Ancient Period (418 B.R. – 1 B.R.)
An interval of increasing record density, expanding inter-polity contact, and the emergence of durable institutions.
Period boundaries reflect later scholarly convention.

## Manorial Period (1 A.R. – 800 A.R.)
An interval defined by post-Reckoning chronography, mature landed institutions, and increasingly regular documentary forms.
Regional and factional calendars may diverge from the A.R. convention.
